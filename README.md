# Godot Community Docs Mirror

Welcome to the Godot Community Docs Mirror repository! This repository hosts a mirror copy of the official Godot Engine documentation available at [https://docs.godotengine.org/](https://docs.godotengine.org/). We are a community-run initiative aimed at providing a backup copy of the documentation to ensure continued accessibility and reliability.

### Access the Mirror
The mirror of the Godot Engine documentation can be accessed at [https://docs.godot.community/](https://docs.godot.community/). Feel free to use this URL as a backup or alternative when browsing the documentation.

### Android App

Additionally, we also maintains an Android app, called "Godot Docs," that allows you to access the entire Godot Engine documentation offline, on the go! You can download the app from the Google Play Store: [Godot Docs on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=community.godot.docs). The app provides an easy and convenient way to access the documentation and receive updates with just one tap.

## About the Mirror

Our mission is to support the Godot community by maintaining an up-to-date mirror of the official Godot Engine documentation. This allows developers and enthusiasts to access the documentation from an alternative source in case the official site experiences downtime or other connectivity issues.

Since we also export the same build to our Android App version, we have made several adjustment to the original documentation to make it more suitable for mobile devices (ie. removing some clutters, etc).
