Compiling for Universal Windows Platform
========================================

.. important::

    Compiling UWP export templates is not implemented in Godot 4.
    Godot 3 has limited UWP support, but there are many
    `known issues <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aplatform%3Auwp>`__.

    We recommend you use the :ref:`Win32 export <doc_exporting_for_windows>` instead.
